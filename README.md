#FAQ Section with Vanilla JS

This project features a simple and interactive FAQ section built using Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to click on questions to reveal or hide the answers, improving user experience with dynamic content interaction. The project was developed as a practice to enhance my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Features:

Toggle functionality to show/hide answers.

Lightweight implementation using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Simple and responsive design suitable for websites or blogs.
