# Faq-Section / Accordino
This project features a simple and interactive FAQ section built using Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to click on questions to reveal or hide the answers, improving user experience with dynamic content interaction. The project was developed as a practice to enhance my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
